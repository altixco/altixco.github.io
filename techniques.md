# TechniquesðŸ’¡

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test-driven development (**TDD**) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (**CI**) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

We implement **CI** with the help of:

- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions){:target="_blank"}
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/){:target="_blank"}

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery (**CD**) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.
